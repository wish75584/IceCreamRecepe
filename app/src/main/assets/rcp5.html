		<h2>INGREDIENTS :</h2>

		<ul>
			<li>3 seville oranges (or 1 eating orange and 2 limes)
</li>
			<li>1Â¾ cups confectioners' sugar
</li>
			<li>2 cups heavy cream
</li>
			<li>6 wafers (to serve)
</li>

		<h2>METHOD :</h2>
		<hr style="background-color: #cd5c5c;height: 2px;border: none;">

		<ul>
			<li>If using Seville oranges, grate the zest of 2 of them. Squeeze the juice of all 3 and pour into a bowl with the zest and sugar. If you're going for the sweet orange and lime option, grate the zest of the orange and one of the limes, juice them and add to the sugar as before.

</li>
			<li>Stir to dissolve the sugar and add the heavy cream.
.

</li>
			<li>Whip everything until it holds soft peaks, and then turn into a shallow air-tight container (of approximately 2 litres / 8 cups) with a lid. (If using American heavy-cream or whipping cream in other countries, whisk your cream in a bowl first, until it reaches soft peaks, then whisk in the other ingredients and continue whisking until thick again.)

 	</li>
			<li>Cover and freeze until firm (from 3 to 5 hours). Remove to ripen for 15-20 minutes (or 30-40 in the fridge) before eating.

	</li>
		<li>Serve in a bowl, in cones, with wafers - however you like.

	</li>
