		<ul>
			<li>Combine the pumpkin purée and sweetened condensed milk in a bowl, and stir to mix.</li>
			<li>Add the cream and whisk until it begins to thicken. (If using American heavy-cream or whipping cream in other countries, whisk your cream in a bowl first, until it reaches soft peaks, then whisk in the sweetened condensed milk mixture and continue whisking until thick again.).</li>
			<li>Grate the nutmeg over the ice cream and whisk in the brandy as you pour it in a slow trickle.</li>
			<li>Decant into your airtight container or containers and freeze overnight. Take it out of the freezer for 10 minutes to soften before serving.</li>
			<li>MAKE AHEAD NOTE: The ice cream can be made and frozen up to 1 week ahead.</li>
			<li>STORE NOTE: Leftover ice cream should be returned to freezer as quickly as possible, and is best eaten within 1 month</li>
