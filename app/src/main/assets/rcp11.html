		<ul>
			<li>Preheat oven to 350Â° (or according to mix instructions, if different). Open mix and measure out 1/2 cup, then set the rest aside.</li>
			<li>Pour 1/2 cup brownie mix into a medium-sized mixing bowl and add sweetened condensed milk. Mix until thoroughly combined, then set aside.</li>
			<li>Bake the remaining brownie mix according to the package's instructions. You may need a few extra minutes to fully cook the center of the brownies, since they'll be a bit fudgier than usual. Set aside to cool, then crumble brownies into bite-sized pieces.</li>
			<li>Pour heavy cream into a large mixing bowl and beat until stiff peaks form, 2 to 3 minutes. (When you remove the whisk from the heavy cream, it should stay standing up.) Fold in the sweetened condensed milk mixture, then most of the brownie bits.</li>
			<li>Pour the mixture into a loaf pan, top with remaining brownie bits and freeze, 5 hours, or up to overnight.</li>
