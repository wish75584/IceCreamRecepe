		<h2>METHOD :</h2>
		<hr style="background-color: #cd5c5c;height: 2px;border: none;">

		<ul>
			<li>Let the ice cream soften either in the fridge for a while, or out in the kitchen.</li>
			<li>Line a 20cm / 8 inch springform tin with clingfilm, both in the bottom and sides of the tin so that you have some overhang at the top.</li>
			<li>Empty the slightly softened ice cream into a bowl and mix in the peanuts, 150g / 1 cup chocolate and peanut butter morsels or chocolate chips, Crunchie bar shards and 100g / 1 cup of the oreo cookies crumbs</li>
			<li>Scrape the ice cream mixture into the springform tin, flattening the top like a cake, cover the top with clingfilm and place in the freezer to firm up. 	</li>
			<li>Serve the cake straight from the freezer, unmoulding from the tin and pulling the clingfilm gently away, before putting on a plate or cake stand. Let it stand and soften for about 5 minutes before cutting.
</li>
			<li>Sprinkle the top of the cake with the extra 50g / ¼ cup of chocolate and peanut butter morsels or chocolate chips, and the remaining oreo cookies crumbs</li>
			<li>Cut into slices and serve with the butterscotch and chocolate sauces, letting both dribble lacily over each slice.</li>
			
			</ul>
